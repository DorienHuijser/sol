## How to be FAIR ##

### Latest FAIR Story About Cognitive Mapping Published ###
In this interview, Femke van Esch tells us about Cognitive Mapping, a method for mapping people's beliefs and reasoning. The previously complicated method was made more user-friendly by developing the new software CognitiveMapr for which she received a grant from the FAIR Research IT Innovation Fund. There are more projects that received a grant from the fund, such as Kees Klein Goldewijk's [HYDE database.](https://www.uu.nl/en/news/the-hyde-portal-makes-the-history-of-land-use-both-accessible-and-visible?utm_source=maileon&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=11835&utm_content=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uu.nl%2Fen%2Fnews%2Fthe-hyde-portal-makes-the-history-of-land-use-both-accessible-and-visible)

### FAIR Cheat Sheets have been Published ###
Finding your way around the FAIR principles may prove to be a little daunting. That is why science historian and philosopher Susanna Bloem made grateful use of the FAIR Cheatsheets developed by experts from the Utrecht University Open Science Programme and RDM Support in consultation with researchers from several faculties. Read all about how she used this useful checklist to see if her data and code adhered to the FAIR principles.

## As Good as New ##

### Data Odyssey project at Geo ###
Remember the times of the floppy disks? Zip drives? CD-ROMS? It seems ages ago, but the data on these carriers are still valuable. The Geo Data Team managed to retrieve the data from these outdated data carriers and opened up the research data that Martin Wassen had collected for over four decades. Watch datasteward Garrett Speed present the project [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzIMNBxTPhg)
